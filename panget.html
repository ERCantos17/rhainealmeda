<p1> I choose this strand because my dream is to be a Engineer to have a great income in my future tho it's difficult to learn in this strand cause it is more in mathematics subjects. It has a lot of mathematics subjects because STEM is Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics strand. Also it is Hands-on STEM programs and activities also to discover real-world applications, spark their creativity and develop 21st-century skills including media and technology literacy, productivity, social skills, communication, flexibility and initiative. </p1>
